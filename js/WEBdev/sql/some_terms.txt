Normalization - method use to remove duplicate data from relation
- 1NF (atomic value) eaach col should have unique records
- 2NF (should be 1NF) non-key atrributes should be completely dependent on primary key else break the table accordingly
- 3NF (should be 2NF) non-key atrributes should be mutually independent

Relation algebra
- sigma for selection of rows
- Pi for selection of columns 
- X cartesian product all possible combination of two relations
    * after cartesian product number of rows is n*p and cols are m+q
